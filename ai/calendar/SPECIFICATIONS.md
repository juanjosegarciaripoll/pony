Compact scope definition for `chronos`.

## Mission

Provide an offline-authoritative, keyboard-first calendar client that keeps its local state transparent and synchronizes with CalDAV servers without duplicating logic across CLI, TUI, and MCP surfaces.

## Existing scope

- Multi-account CalDAV synchronization.
- Local `.ics` mirror plus SQLite index and recurrence cache.
- VEVENT and VTODO support.
- Textual TUI for agenda/day/grid workflows, including mouse creation and
  drag-to-reschedule for non-recurring timed events, with periodic background
  sync while it is open (hourly by default; `g` syncs immediately).
- CLI for sync, inspection, mutation, import, bootstrap, and OAuth authorization.
- MCP tools for search/query/detail plus iTIP-aware `.ics` import.
- OAuth browser loopback authorization where providers require it.
- Distribution through:
  - `uv tool install`
  - Windows installer releases
  - Windows portable PyInstaller bundles

## Desirable scope

- Reliable tagged-release automation.
- Better end-user packaging and installation docs.
- Runtime support for per-account mirror roots.
- TUI OAuth polish and continued UX refinement.

## Deferred or dropped scope

- Background sync daemon.  (The TUI syncs periodically only while it is
  open.)
- Full iTIP / iMIP scheduling.  (Import honors `METHOD:CANCEL` and
  `METHOD:REQUEST`/`SEQUENCE` updates; `METHOD:REPLY`/RSVP, counter
  proposals, and e-mail transport remain out of scope.)
- Free/busy queries.
- VJOURNAL.
- Full `THISANDFUTURE` editing semantics.
- Keyring-backed token storage.

## Product principles

- Local files are authoritative.
- Keyboard workflows first.
- Shared domain logic across every surface.
- Packaging and release automation are part of the product, not an afterthought.
